                            <!-- Description of your superhero-->
                            <p class="card-text">Batman is one of the most iconic and enduring superheroes in the world of comic books and pop culture. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Batman made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Unlike many other superheroes, Batman possesses no superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his intelligence, physical prowess, and an array of high-tech gadgets to fight crime in Gotham City.At the core of Batman's character is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist who witnessed the murder of his parents as a child. This traumatic event fueled his lifelong commitment to eradicating crime. Adopting the persona of Batman, he becomes a symbol of fear for criminals, donning a bat-themed costume and using his extensive martial arts training to combat villains. Batman's rogues' gallery includes iconic foes like the Joker, Two-Face, and the Penguin, each with their unique motivations and quirks. His unwavering dedication to justice and moral code make him a complex and compelling character, as he navigates the fine line between hero and vigilante. Over the decades, Batman has been portrayed in various media, including comic books, television series, animated shows, and numerous blockbuster films, cementing his status as a symbol of justice, darkness, and the enduring human spirit.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Nagraj is a superhero appearing in Indian comic books published by Raj Comics[1] created in the late 1980s by Rajkumar Gupta.[2] Nagraj first appeared in the comics Nagraj GENL #14 which was written by Parshuram Sharma and illustrated by Pratap Mullick.
                                After that Sanjay Ashtpure, Pratap Mullick, Chandu, Milind Misal and Vitthal Kamble alternately illustrated the character for 44 issues, ending in 1995 with Visarpi Ki Shadi.[3][4][5][6]                               
                                Nagraj is believed to have been inspired by the mythological Ichchhadhari Nag (shapeshifting snakes) and historical Vishmanushya (venomous human).[7] His stories create a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic, and science fiction. Many of Nagraj's fans believe that, over time, Nagraj's comics have developed snake mythology of its own, which is unique to the popular Indian beliefs about snakes that are prevalent among the masses. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">Thor is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of humankind, hallowing, and fertility. Thor, deity common to all the early Germanic peoples, a great warrior represented as a red-bearded, middle-aged man of enormous strength, an implacable foe to the harmful race of giants but benevolent toward mankind. His figure was generally secondary to that of the god Odin, who in some traditions was his father; but in Iceland, and perhaps among all northern peoples except the royal families, he was apparently worshiped more than any other god. There is evidence that a corresponding deity named Thunor, or Thonar, was worshiped in England and continental Europe, but little is known about him. </p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Doctor Strange, originally a Marvel Comics character created in 1963, underwent a fascinating evolution from page to screen. In the comics, he's Dr. Stephen Strange, a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon who turns to mysticism after a car accident wrecks his hands. He trains under the Ancient One to become the Sorcerer Supreme, safeguarding Earth from supernatural threats.
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), actor Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Doctor Strange. His 2016 solo film introduced audiences to the character's origin, emphasizing the mystical and mind-bending aspects. He later played vital roles in "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame."
Doctor Strange's transition to film retained his complex character, mystical abilities, and signature artifacts like the Eye of Agamotto. The MCU also explores his role in the multiverse, expanding the narrative possibilities. This adaptation successfully brought the enigmatic world of magic to the big screen, making Doctor Strange a pivotal figure in the cinematic superhero landscape. </p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Captain America, a beloved Marvel Comics character, was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby and made his debut in 1941 during the height of World War II. Steve Rogers, his alter ego, was a frail and determined young man who, through a government experiment, transformed into a super-soldier with enhanced strength, agility, and endurance. Clad in his iconic red, white, and blue costume, Captain America wields a nearly indestructible vibranium shield, which he uses both defensively and offensively in his battles against villains and threats to humanity.
Captain America's journey extended beyond the comic pages to the silver screen, with actor Chris Evans portraying him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Evans donned the shield in several films, including "Captain America: The First Avenger" (2011), "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" (2014), and "Captain America: Civil War" (2016). These movies not only showcased his action-packed adventures but also explored his character's moral dilemmas and his role as a leader within the Avengers. Captain America's appearances in the MCU contributed significantly to his enduring popularity and cemented his status as a cultural icon. </p>

                                wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her "Widow's Bite". She wears no costume during her first few
                                appearances but simply evening wear and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons
                                that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero archer, Hawkeye.After their breakup, the Widow moves to Los Angeles and becomes leader of the newly created and short-lived super team known as The Champions, consisting of her, Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze), Hercules (with whom she has a brief romance), and former X-Men Angel and Iceman.

Her friends usually call her "Natasha", the informal version of "Natalia". She has sometimes chosen the last-name alias "Romanoff". She has hinted to be a descendant of the deposed House of Romanov and a relation to Nicholas II of Russia.

                                Plastic Man, also known as Patrick "Eel" O'Brian, is a character from DC Comics with a captivating origin story. Created by Jack Cole and first appearing in "Police Comics" #1 in 1941, Eel O'Brian started as a small-time crook and safecracker. His life took a dramatic turn when a heist gone wrong resulted in a chemical accident at the Crawford Chemical Works, infusing his body with the remarkable power to stretch, contort,
                                and shape-shift. Embracing his newfound abilities, he adopted the alias "Plastic Man" and chose to use his powers for good, fighting crime and bringing criminals to justice. With the ability to stretch his body to incredible lengths, change his appearance at will, and a near-invulnerability, Plastic Man has become a beloved character in the DC Universe. His most iconic nemesis is the Joker, with whom he has had numerous

                            <p class="card-text">Ant-Man, also known as Scott Lang in the Marvel Universe, is a compelling superhero characterized by his unique ability to shrink down to the size of an ant while simultaneously gaining superhuman strength and agility. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man first appeared in Tales to Astonish #27 in 1962.

Scott Lang, portrayed by actor Paul Rudd in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is a skilled engineer and master thief who stumbles upon the Ant-Man suit, designed by Dr. Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man. With the help of this suit and advanced Pym Particles technology, Lang becomes a formidable hero. Ant-Man's diminutive stature grants him incredible stealth and the ability to communicate with ants, which he uses to execute heists and combat threats.

Despite his small size, Ant-Man plays a significant role in the Avengers and other superhero teams, showcasing that even the tiniest heroes can make a big impact. His humor, relatability, and inventive combat style make him a beloved character in the Marvel Universe.. </p>

                              Aquaman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941).[1]. Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series. During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League. In the 1990s Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.[2]

                            <p>
                              The son of a human lighthouse-keeper and the queen of Atlantis, Aquaman is the alias of Arthur Curry, who also goes by the Atlantean name Orin. Others to use the title of Aquaman include a short-lived human successor, Joseph Curry; his protégé Jackson Hyde; and the mysterious Adam Waterman, who was briefly active during World War II. Aquaman's comic books are filled with colourful undersea characters and a rich supporting cast, including his mentor Vulko, his powerful wife Mera, and various sidekicks such as Aqualad, Aquagirl, and Dolphin. Aquaman stories tend to blend high fantasy and science fiction. His villains include his archenemy Black Manta and his own half-brother Ocean Master, among others.

                            <p class="card-text">Captain Marvel, portrayed by Brie Larson, made her cinematic debut in the 2019 film "Captain Marvel." The movie explored her origin story, showing how Carol Danvers, a former U.S. Air Force pilot, gained her superhuman abilities and became Captain Marvel. It was set in the 1990s and featured her involvement in the Kree-Skrull War.

Captain Marvel's role in "Avengers: Endgame" (2019) was crucial to the overarching narrative. She played a pivotal part in the epic battle against Thanos and helped the Avengers in their quest to reverse the effects of the Infinity Snap. Her immense powers, including flight, energy projection, and super strength, made her a formidable ally.

In the film, Captain Marvel's arrival on the battlefield with her iconic red, blue, and gold suit provided a powerful moment of support for the Avengers. Although she had limited screen time in "Endgame," her presence was instrumental in the ultimate victory against Thanos and his forces, emphasizing her significance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. </p>

                                Green Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination, fearlessness, and the electromagnetic spectrum of emotional willpower.[1] The characters are typically depicted as members of the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic law enforcement agency.

                                The first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell with scripting or co-scripting of the first stories by Bill Finger[2] during the Golden Age of Comic Books and usually fought common criminals in Capitol City (and later, Gotham City) with the aid of his magic ring. For the Silver Age of Comic Books, John Broome and Gil Kane reinvented the character as Hal Jordan in 1959 and introduced the Green Lantern Corps, shifting the nature of the character from fantasy to science fiction. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams introduced John Stewart, a new member of the Corps who was one of DC's first black superheroes. Other notable Green Lanterns include Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz and Jo Mullein.

Black Panther is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-plotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 (July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books.[1][2] Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart- shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, expertise in his nation's traditions, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.
Black Panther is the first protagonist of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early black superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972), and Blade (1973) or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri while he was in a coma for a short time.
Black Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films, and video games. Chadwick Boseman portrayed T'Challa in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's films: Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and posthumously voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the animated series What If...? (2021); while Letitia Wright, who played Shuri in previous MCU films, took over the Black Panther mantle in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), following Boseman's death in 2020. </p>

Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #4 (March 1964) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Originally said to have the ability to alter probability, the Scarlet Witch has been depicted as a powerful sorceress since the 1980s and on occasion has become powerful enough to alter reality by tapping into greater energy sources.The Scarlet Witch is first depicted as a reluctant supervillain along with her twin brother, Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver, both founding members of the Brotherhood of Mutants. A year after her debut, she joined the Avengers superhero team and ever since has often been depicted as a regular member of that or related teams (such as the West Coast Avengers and Force Works). In 1975, she married her android teammate Vision, later using borrowed magical forces to make herself pregnant, resulting in twin sons William ("Billy") and Thomas ("Tommy"). Stories in 1989 wiped Tommy and Billy from existence (they would later reappear as the heroes called Wiccan and Speed) and removed Vision's emotions, leading to the annulment of his and Wanda's marriage.
For most of her comic book history, the Scarlet Witch is portrayed as a mutant, a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with an "X-gene" that grants superhuman abilities and traits, although multiple stories also said the nature of her mutant powers were influenced by the High Evolutionary experimenting on her when she was a child. A 2015 storyline revised Wanda's origin, establishing that her superhuman traits are entirely a result of experimentation done by the High Evolutionary and on inherited magic abilities. Like Franklin Richards and other characters, her genetics were such that standard X-gene tests gave a false positive, meaning she was never actually born a mutant.[7]
The character's in-universe backstory and parentage have changed more than once. During the 1960s, she and Quicksilver are said to be the mutant twin offspring of two unnamed parents. Later, it is said the children were given to the geneticist called the High Evolutionary, leaving their true parentage a mystery. In 1974, it is said their parents are Golden Age heroes Bob Frank / Whizzer and Madeline Joyce Frank / Miss America. Wanda then refers to herself as Wanda Frank for a time. In 1979, they are revealed to have been raised by human Romani parents, Django and Marya Maximoff. In 1982, Magneto concludes he is Wanda and Pietro's father. In 2014, the AXIS crossover revealed Pietro and Wanda are not related to Magneto. In 2015, the twins discover they are not mutants and their superhuman traits are the result of the High Evolutionary's experiments combined with Wanda genetically being a Witch born with natural magical abilities. The 2015–2017 Scarlet Witch series reveals Wanda and Pietro's adopted parents Django and Marya Maximoff are biologically their aunt and uncle. Their real mother is confirmed to be Natalya Maximoff, the previous Scarlet Witch, a Romani sorceress whose father was the Scarlet Warlock.
